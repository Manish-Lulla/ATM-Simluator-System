The ATM Simulator Machine is a Java-based application that mimics the core functionalities of a real ATM. It allows users to register as new users and login with a username and password for secure access. Key features include depositing and withdrawing money, along with a fast cash withdrawal option for quick transactions. The system also provides users with their transaction history, a balance check feature, and is fully integrated with SQL for secure and persistent data storage. This project aims to enhance user interaction by simulating real-world ATM functionalities in a streamlined, easy-to-use interface.
